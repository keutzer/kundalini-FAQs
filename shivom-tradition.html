<h2> The Path of Siddha Mahayoga
</h2>
</center>

There are numerous ways to awaken kundalini but generally these
approaches may divided into
two groups.
In the first group are paths such as Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga,
Laya Yoga or Raja Yoga. In these paths the kundalini is awakened through
the effort of the individual. In the second group is the path that is
variously called Sahaja Yoga, Kundalini Yoga or Siddha Mahayoga. In this
path the kundalini is spontaneously awakened by the grace of the Siddha guru
in a process that is called <i>shaktipat</i>.
This path is called Siddha Mahayoga because the processes of Mantra Yoga,
Hatha Yoga, Laya Yoga and Raja Yoga  all take place spontaneously after
being initiated through the grace of a Siddha.
This path of Siddha Yoga can be briefly described as follows:
The Siddha Guru conveys shaktipat initiation to the disciple by means of
touch, word or intention.
Upon initiation the various practices of Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga
occur spontaneously due to the activation of kundalini.
After some time the mind becomes concentrated
the prana becomes steady, and with this Laya Yoga is said to be accomplished.
Finally, through the steadiness of prana the union of the individual
soul with the supreme Self is achieved and the goal of Raja Yoga is
accomplished. As Swami Narayan Tirth said:
<blockquote>
Mantra, Hatha, Laya and Raja Yogas are not separate from one another.
They are merely the divisions of categories of
a single yoga.  Through practicing these four in their respective order and
attaining competency is called Mahayoga.  Knowledge
will not be attained by depending on only one of the four,
and only by attending wholly to all four will natural yoga, that is the
union of the individual soul with the supreme Self, be perfected.
</blockquote>

<p>
The path of Siddha Mahayoga is not a modern invention but in fact
it has a history of at least
one thousand years. References to initiation through shaktipat can be found
in classical works such as the Yoga Vashishta, Shiva Purana, the Kularnava
Tantra and in the
works of the great scholar and yogi, Abhinavagupta.
In many works the role of the guru is emphasized but in no work is it
better epitomized than in the Shiva Sutras which states in Chapter 2, Verse
6:
<p>
<center>
<i>gururupayah
</i>
<p>
</center>
In translation, this verse states that: ``The guru is the means (to
liberation).''
<p>
If one is intrigued by the promise of the path of Siddha Mahayoga
it is natural to seek out a teacher who can offer
shaktipat initiation.
Traditional sources on the path of Siddha Mahayoga encourage a careful
review of the prospective disciple by the Siddha Guru as well as a review
of the qualities of the Guru by the disciple.
The qualities of a Guru are described in classical works of the path of
Siddha Mahayoga and the Thirteenth Chapter of the Kularnava Tantra gives an
extensive list of the qualities.  First and foremost a Guru is expected to
have a high degree of self-realization. Secondly a Guru is expected to have
the knowledge and the capacity for conveying (shaktipat) initiation.
Thirdly the Guru is expected to have a knowledge of the aspects of the
path. Finally a Guru's behavior is expected to reflect his state of
realization.
<p>
Even the literature of one thousand years ago discuss the difficulty of
finding a Guru that embodies all these characteristics.
As to the actual selection
of a guru the classical works are quite pragmatic. 
They encourage a
critical attitude in the beginning and only after the Guru has met one's
criteria does one take initiation from him. From this point onwards they
encourage unwavering devotion to the Guru. Unfortunately these days many
students choose the opposite approach. They quickly adopt a devoted
attitude toward a teacher and take initiation but over time some students
become more and more critical of the teacher. This approach is generally
ill-advised and is especially disastrous in the path of Siddha Mahayoga.
Once one's kundalini is awakened through Guru's grace a variety of
experiences may occur, some of these potentially terrifying. At these times
a total confidence in the Siddha Guru is absolutely necessary to calm the
anxiety. If, on the other hand, at these moments one has residual doubts
regarding the Guru then one's anxiety and discomfort can become even more
amplified.  The literature of Siddha Yoga does acknowledge that a student
may progress from one teacher to another but in doing so the student should
never doubt or criticize prior teachers.

<h2> The Lineage of Swami Shivom Tirth
</h2>
</center>
<p>
The known tradition of the contemporary Siddha Guru, Swami Shivom Tirth,
begins with the figure of Swami Gangadhar Tirth. 
From there it
continues with Swami Narayan Tirth.
Swami Narayan Tirth passed the tradition of Siddha Mahayoga to
Shri Yogananda Maharaj.
Shri Yogananda Maharaj passed this tradition onto Swami Vishnu Tirth.
Swami Vishnu Tirth received his initiation into the renunciate
tradition of the Tirtha order from Swami Purushottam Tirth, an
initiate of Swami Narayan Tirth.
With Swami Vishnu Tirth this tradition began to appeal to a broader public.
For over forty years Swami Vishnu Tirth's book
<i>Devatma Shakti </i>  has been one of the most
reliable references on the path of Siddha Mahayoga.
Swami Vishnu Tirth passed on this tradition to his most favored disciple
Swami Shivom Tirth.
Having retired from his duties as
Swami Shivom Tirth has, in turn, passed on his lineage and responsibilities
to Swami Shiv Mangal Tirth.
Brief biographies of these inspiring individuals are given below. These
biographies are drawn from the writings and discourses
of Swami Shivom Tirth and Swami Shiv Mangal Tirth.
