Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj, also known as Munilal Swami, was born in Jazzar
of the District of Rohtak in Haryana State. He always had a love for
spiritualism.  While still a young man, he had a divine experience that
occurred while living in a hostel as a student. He was resting on his roof
at night when he saw a huge circle of fire approaching. Ultimately this
circle of fire entered into his person and disappeared. He thereafter
experienced a sort of intoxication and trembling in the form of automatic
movements and breath control.   

After passing his matriculation, Munilal stayed with his uncle who was
employed by the Railways at Nagpur, where he obtained his undergraduate
degree. After graduation, he  married and was employed as a teacher in
Bilaspur in Madhya Pradesh. While teaching, he simultaneously obtained a
postgraduate degree  and passed the L.L.B. from Aligarh University.
Thereafter he began practicing as a lawyer in Ghaziabad Tehsil of the
District of Meerut. 

The seeds of spiritualism were deeply rooted in him from the very
beginning. At first, he was not clear about the meaning of his strange
experience. He met a number of holy persons and practiced Yoga. He devoted
himself to deep study of Indian classics and scriptures. His life was very
simple and truthful. Naturally the job as a legal practitioner did not suit
him well.

There was a judge named Mehra in Ghaziabad. Shri Yoganandaji Maharaji was
his Guru. Learning of this, Munilal wrote a letter to Shri Yoganandaji and
very soon afterward received a favorable reply. His wife had expired
already and his son and daughter were both married. He was thus free from
the burden of his family. All these factors soon led him to decide to
renounce the world in search of enlightenment. This decision took him on a
path straight to Rishikesh.   

Munilal met Shri Yoganandaji in the Swargashram at Rishikesh and received
Shaktipat initiation from him. This was in the year 1933. Afterwards he
traveled to many religious places around Badrinath and Kedarnath.  In 1939,
Munilal expressed a desire for initiation into the system of Sanyas, and
Yoganandaji directed him to Swami Shankar Purushottan Tirth Maharaj in
Benaras.  Swami Shankar Purushottan Tirth initiated Munilal into the system
of Sanyas in the Mohan Ashram of Haridwar near the bank of the holy river
Ganges. His name became Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj after the initiation. As
per the direction of Shri Yoganandaji, Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj proceeded
toward Indore and finally settled in Dewas where he laid the foundation of
Narayan Kuti Sanyas Ashram.   

Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj initiated many spiritual aspirants into the
system of Shaktipat and wrote a number of books including Sadhana Sanket,
Shaktipat, Adhyatma Vikas, Atma Prabodh, Prana Tattva, Upanishadvani,
Geetatatwamrit, Shiva Sutra Prabodhini, and a commentary on Saundrya Lahiri
and Prityabhigyahridyam.. He wrote one memorable book in English titled
Devatma Shakti which is a rare contribution to the field of Yoga
philosophy.

Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj had a profound love for the Ganges River and he
spent around two months a year near the river in Rishikesh. His disciples
soon carried out the construction of a center in Rishikesh in 1965 which
came to be known as Yoga Shri Pith. Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaja occupies a
prominent place in the galaxy of Shaktipat Gurus. He was highly educated
and had a sharp and brilliant mind. He left his mortal body in 1969
dissolving into the Absolute.  

Books available in English by Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj are:

Devatma Shakti.   An indepth study of the Divine Power (Devatma Shakti) and
the science of Shaktipat.  This work is based on traditions recorded in
ancient scriptures supplemented by direct experiences of divine revelation.
This book is considered a classic in the field of Shaktipat and the
awakening of internal consciousness.    


SWAMI SHIVOM TIRTH MAHARAJ

Shri Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj was the most favorite disciple of Swami
Vishnu Tirth Maharaj. The field of activity of Shri Swami Vishnu Tirth
Maharaj was considerably wide and he set a number of milestones in the
expansion of the movement of the Shaktipat system. His successor Shri Swami
Shivom Tirth Maharaj, the present Guru Maharaj of Ashrams in India and the
USA, has, however, gone beyond the horizon after solidifying the work of
his revered Guru. Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj was originally named Om
Prakash when he was a householder before joining Shri Swami Vishnu Tirthji
Maharaj. He was born in 1924 in the village of Gujrat in Punjabi into a
respectable family. He had a deep interest in religion and a strong liking
for spiritualism from the very beginning. He studied for his undergraduate
degree in Lahore. Afterwards he started leading a simple but highly ideal
life.   

Om Prakash and his family were duly affected by the partition of the
country which consequently compelled him to leave Lahore along with his
family. He took a job in Punjabi but soon left and devoted himself to
higher objectives and began searching for a competent teacher. After coming
to know about the spiritual attainments of Shri Swami Vishnu Tirthji
Maharaj, he sought his permission to join him. On receiving Swamiji's
consent, Shri Om Prakash bid farewell to his family and was thereafter
called Brahmachari Shivom Prakash following his initiation in 1959.

Shri Shivom Prakash, while attaining considerable spiritual elevation in
the company of his Guru, dedicated himself completely to the alteration,
modification and improvement of the newly established centers at Dewas and
Rishikesh. His unmatched dedication and total surrender to his Guru was a
model for others. His steady silent devotion can be well compared with
Eklavya, the unrecognized disciple of Dronacharya, who once happened to
beat the great warrior Arjuna but ultimately sacrificed his right thumb
when demanded by his Guru, Drona. What we see today at the Narayan Kuti
Sanyas Ashram in Dewas is the result of the incessant labor of Brahmachari
Shivom Prakash. He was concurrently undertaking a deep study of all the
important Hindu classics and scriptures. Swami Vishnu Tirthji was very much
impressed by the selfless surrender of Shri Shivom Prakash. He arranged for
the Brahmachari to in be in the company of many spiritual personalities and
took him around to many important religious centers. After receiving
initiation into the order of renunciation (Sanyas), which he took in 1963
from Shri Narayan Tirth Maharaj (Kashi), he was given the new name of Swami
Shivom Tirth. Shri Swami Vishnu Tirthji Maharaj afterwards authorized Swami
Shivom Tirth to succeed him and propagate the system of Shaktipat for the
welfare of all people. Since then, Swami Shivom Tirth has accomplished the
task of &gt;&gt;kindling the fire of knowledge<< in different countries of the world, all of which Swami Gangadhar Tirthji had predicted. Swamiji is all loving and embracing. His charming and dignified personality attracts people from every walk of life and almost captivates them by the magnetism of his personality. He holds among his following Hindus, Muslim, Sikhs, Christians, Jews, Chinese, and Japanese. The system of Shaktipat has already gained ground in Europe and America. Swamiji has also undertaken foreign trips whenever he has felt his need abroad. The special trait of Swamiji's character is that each and every follower believes that he is the one most liked by Swamiji. This is for no other reason except that Swamiji is constantly showering universal grace and he has a natural affection and sympathy for those in need. His knowledge is unfathomable and humility touching. He is extremely simple and yet at times remarkably witty. The following are some of his important works in English: A Guide to Shaktipat. This book is written in a question and answer format, and covers many of the commony asked questions concerning Shaktipat, Pantanjali's Yoga Darshan, methods of awakening the kundalini power and meditation. This book also contains an introduction to the tradition of Shaktipat. Although the system of Shaktipat is very old, the system witnessed a revival during the late nineteenth century through Swami Gangadhar Tirth Maharaj. The history of the transmission of Shakti from Swami Gangadhar Tirth Maharaj through each successive guru in this notable line up to the present time is reviewed. Jana Kiran (Rays of Ancient Wisdom), by Shri Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj. Selected lectures by Swami Shivom Tirth on Shaktipat, Karma Yoga, the mantra, and meditation. Sadhan Path: A Guide to Meditation, by Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj. This newly published book is a rich source of information on meditation. First published in 1961, the Hindi version of this book was widely received. Now in English for the first time, this 
book deals with requirements for those entering the path of meditation, necessary mental preparations, the necessity of finding a qualified guru, and meditation and the experience of divine ecstasy. Shivom Vani: The Songs of Shivom, by Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj. Also new, this is the first English translation of the beautiful poems of Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj. These poems have been set to music in India by musicians of national reputation. These poems have been described as moving, haunting, and inspiring, and are considered by many to be the author's finest work. This work represents not only the great wisdom of a true spiritual master, but also a significant work of creative art in metaphysical poetry.
