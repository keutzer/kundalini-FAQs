Shri Yoganandaji Maharaj, originally known as Daya Shankar, was born in
Junagar, Gujrat at the beginning of  the present century. The exact place
of birth of Shri Yoganadaji is not known since he was always reluctant to
give any  details about his private life. He confined himself to talking 
about Yoga practices, devotion and spiritual advancement. The father of
Shri Yogananda died quite early and the family became poverty  stricken;
consequently his educational advancement was limited. His initial efforts
of earning his livelihood in Bombay  failed as he was totally
straightforward in his dealings with people. In addition, he had a genuine
love for the company of saints. His indifference toward  the world
gradually increased and ultimately he renounced his home in search of a
competent master. At that time, he was attracted to Shri Tri Vikram Swami,
a spiritual master who resided near Prabhas Patan, and  Shri Atmanandaji
Saraswati, who resided in Brahma Teertha near  the Ganges. He acquired a
knowledge of yoga but was not satisfied with it. Ultimately he  met Shri
Krishnanandaji Maharaj, a Bengali Brahmachari (aspirant of God). The
Brahmachari was a great devotee and used  to do japa (chanting) of the
Gayatri Mantra constantly. 
<p>
The two became so close to each other that they became lifelong companions.
Although the Brahmachari was basically a devotee and Daya Shankar had
interest only in yoga, their intimacy and liking for each other were that
of a teacher and a  disciple. Brahmachari Krishnananda was always keenly
searching for a competent teacher of yoga for his disciple, Daya  Shankar.
At last Krishnanandaji came to know about 
<a href="narayan.html">Swami Narayan Tirth Maharaj</a> 
of East Bengal and they set out to meet  him. They reached there after a long
journey. Krishnanandaji approached Swami  Narayan Tirth in the following
straightforward manner: &quot;If  you really have anything to give, please
shower your grace on my disciple but please do not confuse us any further.&quot;
<p>
 The swami  replied, &quot;I am not a hypocritical saint. If your disciple
remains unsatisfied with me, it would mean that there is something 
basically wrong with his state of consciousness. You have, any way, come to
the right place and I can only assure you not to doubt about the true light
that your disciple can get here.&quot; The  Swami thereafter initiated Daya
Shankar into Shaktipat, who  came to be known as Yogananda Brahmachari and
finally as Yogendra Vigyani.
<p>
Shri Yoganandaji and the Brahmachari stayed together in the Ashram 
(spiritual center) and continued spiritual practices. Shri Yoganandji soon
started having rich yoga experiences. He experienced a number of automatic
movements during his meditation. The Swami was very pleased with
Krishnanandaji, whom he wanted to empower for the purpose of initiating
others, but Krishnanandaji, basically a devotee, declined this and instead
requested Swamiji to empower Yoganandaji with the ability to initiate
others. Yoganandaji, who was only sitting there, clarified that he was
already empowered to initiate others as Swamiji had so desired through
Brahmachariji. He thereafter bowed down before the two saints who actually
blessed him with that power.
<p>
On the way back from the Ashram of Swami Narayan Tirth Maharaj, Yoganandaji
sojourned for some time in a few other spiritual centers. He experienced
many miraculous and mysterious automatic movements during his sadhana.
Finally, he thought of settling down after constructing a cottage in the
village of Mandu near the Ganges River in Uttar Pradesh. However, when the
place was ready, Brahmachari Krishnanandji, visiting there, declared that
the center was polluted by the affairs of money, and that it was an
undeserving place for Yoganandaji to live. Yoganandaji therefore
immediately left the new Ashram and never looked back. He thereafter stayed
in Swargashram in Rishikesh and established Vigyan Ashram there. Later on
he became known as Yogendra Vigyani. Shri Yoganandaji initiated a number of
aspirants into the Shaktipat system, including 
<a href="vishnutirth.html">Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj</a>
and
<a href="purushottam.html">Swami Shankar Pururushottam Tirtha</a>.
He wrote a notable book in Hindi entitled <i>Mahayog Vigyan</i>. He left his
mortal form in 1959 dissolving into the Absolute.
