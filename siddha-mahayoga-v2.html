<p>
``Kundalini'' literally means coiling, like a snake.
In the classical literature of hatha yoga kundalini is 
described as a coiled 
serpent at the base of the spine. The image of coiling, like a 
spring, conveys the sense of untapped potential energy. 
Perhaps more meaningfully kundalini can be described as a 
great reservoir of creative energy at the base of the spine.
It's not useful to sit with our consciousness fixed in our 
head and think of kundalini as a foreign force running up 
and down our spine.  Unfortunately the serpent image may 
serve to accentuate this alien nature of the image. It's more 
useful to think of kundalini energy as the very foundation 
of our consciousness so when kundalini moves through the 
sushumna and through our cakras our consciousness 
necessarily changes with it. 
<p>
The concept of kundalini can also be examined from a strictly psychological perspective.
From this perspective kundalini can be thought 
of as a rich source of psychic or libidinous energy in our 
unconscious.
<p>
In the classical literature of Kashmir Shaivism kundalini is described in  three different manifestions. The first of these is as the universal energy or <i> para-kundalini</i>.
The second of these is as the energizing function of the body-mind complex or 
<i>prana-kundalini</i>. The third of these is as consciousness or <i>shakti-kundalini</i> which simultaneously subsumes and intermediates between these two. Ultimately these three forms are the same but understanding these three different forms will help to understand the differerent manifestations of kundalini.

<p><a name="2"><h2><i>What does kundalini have to do with spiritual enlightenment? What is the goal of kundalini yoga?</i></h2></a>
<p>
First we need a few concepts:  In yogic anatomy the 
sushumna is the central channel and conduit for the 
kundalini energy that runs along our spine and up to the 
crown of our head. Along this channel are placed additional 
channel networks called cakras. These cakras are associated 
with major aspects of our anatomy - for example our 
throat, heart, solar plexus, and in turn these aspects of our 
anatomy are related to aspects of our human nature. 
According to the literature of kundalini yoga our experience
of these centers is limited due to knots which restrict the flow
of energy  into these centers. Three knots are particuarly important.
The knot of <i>Brahma</i> which restricts the center at the base of the
spine.
The knot of <i>Vishnu </i> which restricts the heart center and the knot of 
<i>Rudra</i> which
restricts the center between the eyebrows.
These knots form an important framework in yogic thinking and the
stages toward enlightenment are articulated in terms of breaking through
these knots in the yogic classic the <i>Hatha Yoga Pradipika</i> as well
as in some of the yoga upanishads.
 Specifically, four stages of progress are described:
<br>
<i>arambha</i>,
<br>
<i>ghata</i>,
<br>
<i>parichaya</i> and
<br>
<i>nishpatti</i>.
<p>
<i>Arambha</i> is associated with breaking the knot of <i>Brahma</i> and the
awakening of kundalini.
<i>Ghata</i> is associated with breaking the knot of <i>Vishnu</i> and and
with internal absorption.
<i>Parichaya</i> the absorption deepens and in <i>nishpatti</i> the knot of
<i>Rudra</i> is pierced and the kundalini may ascend to the center at the
crown of the head. In this state transcendence is integrated and, according to
the yogic liteature, the yogi has nothing more to attain.
<p>

<p>
Putting these elaborate physiological decriptions aside, the goal of kundalini
yoga is the same as the goal of any legimitate spiritual practice: To be
liberated from the limited bounds of the self-centered and alienated ego.
In kundalini yoga this is associated with internal manifestations of the
kundalini but the external manifestations should be similar to any other
legitiimate spiritual practice.

<a name="4"><h2><i> So how do I awaken kundalini?</i></h2></a>

Indirectly kundalini can be awakened by devotion, by selfless service,  or
by intellectual enquiry. 
<p>

Broadly speaking there are two radically different direct approaches to
awakening kundalini. One approach requires initiation by a guru and relies
upon a technique called 
shaktipat, or ``descent of shakti.''  It is variously called:
Siddha Mahayoga, Kundalini Mahayoga or  Sahaja Yoga (Spontaneous Yoga). 
These approaches are treated in the  <a href="siddha-mahayoga.html">Siddha Mahayoga FAQ</a>.
The other approach uses intentional yogic techniques . The styles using  intentional techniques include Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Laya Yoga  or Kriya Yoga.
These approaches are treated in the  <a href="kundalini-yogas.html">Kundalini Yogas FAQ</a> .
<p>
Fundamentally the approach of Siddha Mahayoga and the Kundalini Yogas are different. In Siddha Mahayoga the guru awakens the kundalini and after that the core of the practice is the inactive and non-willful surrender to kundalini. In Kundalini Yogas the will is used to awaken the kundalini and to guide its progress. Clearly these are different approaches. Nevertheless, elements of the each approach occur in the practices of the other. Siddha Mahayogins may use asanas, pranayamas and other hatha yoga practices. On the other hand gurus in Kundalini Yoga may give infusions of shakti to their students to help them at particular points in their practice.

<a name="5"><h2> <i>What is shaktipat?</i></h2></a>

``Shakti'' is another word for kundalini and ``pat'' means to descend.
Shaktipat is a method by which an individual's kundalini is awakened by the
direct intervention of a guru. There are several varieties of shaktipat
depending on the facility of the guru and the receptiveness of the
disciple.  
<p>

There are a variety of mechanisms for conveying shaktipat. These include:
by glance, by word or mantra, by touch or simply by intention.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="6"><h2><i>How does shaktipat work? If kundalini awakening is so important how can someone else do it for you? How could a guru overcome my karma?</h2></i></a>

There is a rich literature exploring this point but a couple analogies may
help more. In the classical literature, such as the works of tantric scholar Abhinavagupta, shaktipat is seen as able to occur when one's positive and negative karmas reach a sort of equilibrium. 
<p>
A couple analogies may also help here. Ordinarily it takes a long time to create a fire by rubbing
sticks together but if someone else already has a fire then that fire can
be used to ignite another fire. Similarly to make a magnet naturally may
require thousands of years but if one already has a magnet then a metal can
easily be magnetized using the magnet.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="7"><h2> <i>Who can give shaktipat?</i></h2></a>

To continue the analogy, in theory ``anyone on fire'' can give shaktipat,
i.e. anyone who's kundalini is already awakened. The more relevant question
is: ``Who *should* give shaktipat?'' There are many opinions on this but at
the very least the conveyer of shaktipat should be aware of the movements
of shakti in his own body and in the body of the disciple. Giving shaktipat
is a science and it is helpful, if not essential, to be instructed in that
science. The classical works of Abhinavagupta and the living oral tradition
of contemporary masters, such as Swami Shivom Tirth, both indicate that
improperly practiced shaktipat initiation can be dangerous both two the
disciple to the guru and to the disciple. Using the analogy again, it is
easier to light a fire than to light it in such a way that it has a
carefully managed burning.
<p>

Therefore, it is desirable that the guru be empowered to give shaktipat by
his own guru and has been trained in an unbroken lineage back to a great
master who was fully aware of the science of shaktipat. In this way some
quality control is maintained. 

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="8"><h2> Who can receive shaktipat?</h2></a>

There are even more opinions on this. Some gurus take an attitude of:
``Initiate them all and let shakti sort them out.''  Traditionally teachers
were quite selective about who received shaktipat. Sometimes shaktipat was
only given to one or two disciples in a generation. Among gurus these days
you can see these two extremes of opinion and many other gradations in
between. What is clear that some people who have received shaktipat from
well-known gurus have apparently only manifested greater neuroses and
unhappiness in their lives as a result.  See the question regarding kriyas
below.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="9"><h2> Are all shaktipat initiations the same?</h2></a>

There are many ways of classifying shaktipat initiations but a method used
by Swami Vishu Tirth is very simple and clear. In *shaktopaya* initiations
the kundalini shakti of the disciple is awakened by the guru. In
*shambhavopaya* initiations the kundalini shakti of the disciple is
awakened and led up through the cakras brining a glimpse of the highest
realization.  Due to the current state of disciples, and contemporary
gurus, almost all initiations can be termed *shaktopaya* initiations.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="10"><h2> Can one receive shaktipat just by being in the presence of those with awakened shakti?</h2></a>

There is no doubt that shakti is contagious. The mere presence of a single
being whose shakti is strongly active can awaken  the shakti of those
around him. Similarly being in the presence of many people whose shakti is
awakened to some degree can awaken one's shakti.  Strictly speaking this is
not the same as shaktipat initiation and 

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="11"><h2> So what happens after shaktipat? What's the practice?</h2></a>

In Siddha Mahayoga once the kundalini is awakened it is considered that the
awakened kundalini, being itself an intelligent force, will direct the
practice.  All that is required is surrender to that force. Then
spontaneous purifying movements, called *kriyas*, typically occur. 
<p>

Even to reach the point of simply surrendering to shakti takes some
practice for people.  Some aids in cultivating surrender are chanting and
selfless service. These practices open the heart and make one more
susceptible to the influence of shakti.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="12"><h2> What are kriyas?</h2></a>

Kriyas, literally ``activities'', are spontaneous movements that occur
after  kundalini awakening. The include body activities such as trembling,
shaking and spontaneous yoga postures;  speech activities such as yelling,
or spontaneous chanting and mental  activities such as visions. These
kriyas eliminate the blocks to kundalini rising within the sushumna.  The
kundalini removes the blocks to its ascent through kriyas. 
<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="13"><h2> How do kriyas purify one's consciousness?</h2></a>

Blocks, known as  *samskaras* or impressions, do not just obstruct
kundalini, but they  embody attachments, conceptions and other mental
afflictions that limit the freedom of our consciousness.  Left unattended
these attachments lead to actions which only reinforce the attachment. For
example if we have impressions of anger then we will manifest anger in our 
activities which only reinforce our impressions. As kundalini rises it will
purify the anger and as a result of the purification process the kriyas
will occur. Speaking of kundalini as an intelligent force which manifests
its intelligence in particular activities, such as spontaneous yoga
postures, to purify the blocks to its progress may sound a little mystical
but there is a less mystical way of understanding what that means.  
<p>

In our common language there are many colloquial phrases which allude to
the natural state of our body-mind as being ``straight'' or ``upright'' and
the unnatural state being ``kinky'' or ``entangled.'' We say positively:
``He's an upright individual.'' ``She's as straight as an arrow.'' We say
negagively: ``He's to kinky. He's all tangled up in himself.'' ``She's
tangled up in knots.'' There seems to be some subtle awareness of the value
of straightness. So it seems to be a good metaphor to view our mind-body
continuum as a garden hose and the kundalini as water running through it.
If you have a moderately tangled garden house a simple way of making it
straight is to increase the pressure of water through it. As you do so the
hose will naturally flip around to straighten itself.  To an observer it
might seem as though the hose itself were intelligent in the way it
straightens itself and in fact because the motion of the hose is governed
by physical laws it does reflect a deep intelligence. 
<p>

In the same way we don't need to think of the kundalini as an independent
autonoumous force cogitating as to what asana,  pranayama or verbal activity
might purify a block inside us. It seems more useful to think of kundalini
as a natural intelligent force whose natural movement untangles the knots
which limit its expression.
<p>

The garden hose analogy makes another point clear as well. Imagine what
happens if the hose is very tangled. Turning up the water pressure may be a
very dramatic  and perhaps even counter-productive process. This seems to
be what is happening in a number of cases where individuals, after
receiving shaktipat,  may have severe mental breakdowns. Thus it does seem
to be important for individuals to have a certain level of stability and
preparation before receiving shaktipat initiation.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="14"><h2> Are these kriyas some sort of self-hypnosis or some sort New Age phenomenon?</h2></a>

This yoga is at least 1000 years old and is documented in the Kularnava
Tantra and in the works of the great Tantric scholar Abhinvagupta and
particular forms of kriyas can be found there.  Some popular yogis and
scholars have doubted the authenticity of this path but none who have done
so show any familiarity with the classical literature of this tradition.
This approach has gone under many names such as siddha yoga, sahaja yoga,
mahayoga or siddha mahayoga. Similar phenomena to kriyas also occur among
some Qi Gong students.  Spontaneous trembling, shaking, verbal noises, and
body movements are common there as well.
<p>

Nevertheless gatherings of siddha mahayoga practicioners share many of the
same characteristics of any other group gathering.  Some people will try to
fit in by emulating the  behavior of those around them. There is no doubt
that some people may feel the need to affect kriyas and others will
accentuate kriyas that they have. This may not even be conscious behavior.
Gurus of this yoga must try to maintain a balance between interfering with
the activity of the kundalini as manifested in the kriyas and encouraging
the affectation of kriyas because kriyas are seen as ``progress.''
Ultimately the validity of any spiritual tradition rests in its ability to
transform the beings of its followers. The real value of siddha mahayoga is
in transforming the minds of those who practice it.

<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="15"><h2> Haven't a number of well-known teachers have criticized kriyas? They say that kundalini is a force that needs control.</h2></a>

Some teachers do speak that way. For example the well known kundalini yoga
teacher, Yogi Bhajan, apparently called the process of experiencing kriyas
``jerk yoga.''   Tibetan practicioners of gTummo yoga, Indian practicioners
of kriya yoga and other noted authorities on the kundalini yoga process
have clearly emphasized to me the importance of carefully  controlling  the
kundalini process and not allowing the kundalini to act uncontrollably.
Their sincere words cast doubt on my practice for many years. 
<p>

So why do these teachers say these things? To be an adept of kundalini yoga
practices does not imply that you are omniscient. All the information that
people like Yogi Bhajan are really conveying is that in their experience in
their style of practicing kundalini yoga the kundalini is controlled. I do
not believe that they have special insight into other alternative ways of
approaching the practice of kundalini yoga. Some people have quite
frightening movements in meditation and without prior experience of kriyas
the natural reaction is that such a person will almost certainly become
physically or mentally unstable. Experienced masters of Siddha Mahayoga,
such as Swami Shivom Tirth, have seen it all before and their simple
counsel is: ``Do not resist kriyas in any way.''
<p>

For the individual who does surrender to the kriyas of kundalini  shakti
the perspective is radically different from the view espoused by teachers
such as Yogi Bhajan.  For the individual who spontaneously and effortlessly
performs  kriyas such as intricate pranayamas, asanas and bandhas during
their meditation the  intentional exercises of the Hatha yogin are a merely
a clumsy  mockery of the subtle activity of kundalini. In fact some claim
that the entire corpus of Hatha yoga, as well as many of the Qi Gong
exercises are simply imitations and classifications of the spontaneous
movements of the Siddha Mahayogin.
<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="16"><h2>16. What is the philosophy of Siddha Mahayoga?</h2></a>

Perhaps its best to say that contemporary forms of siddha mahayoga have a
core of underlying tenets but not a philosophy. These tenets include: the
central role of kundalini in the manifestion of the universe and the
evolution of the individual and the culmination of the evolution of the
individual in a state of complete unity. 
<p>

Different teachers have exposited Siddha Mahayoga in different ways. Swami
Muktananda drew on a wide variety of Indian literature but principally
relied upon the Shiva Sutras, the Spanda Karikas and other literature of
the Trika school of  Shaivism. Swami Shivom Tirth has also relied up on the
Shiva Sutras to define the different stages of evolution. Both Swami Shivom
Tirth and Swami Kriplavananda have used Patanjali's Yoga Sutras for their
elucidation of the states of samadhi. All of these teachers are quick to
note that the use of these scriptures does not imply that Siddha Mahayoga
is a form of Hinduism. Instead the emphasis is that each of us has the
force of kundalini within us and having awakened the kundalini our life and
religious practice will be enriched.
<p>

There are really only a few tenets of the practice of siddha mahayoga. The
first is that the process begins with shaktipat initiation by the guru. 
This initiation may begin with a formal request from the disciple and
culminate with a formal initiation ceremony or it may occur informally
through a impromptu manifestation of the guru's grace in intention, 
glance, word or touch. Through the initiation the kundalini shakti is
awakened and begins to move in the disciples body. The practice then
consists of deeply surrendering to the spontaneous manifestations of
kundalini shakti, as described above.
<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<a name="17"><h2>What is the precise role of the guru in Siddha Mahayoga?</h2></a>

The role of the guru is laid out in the text the Shiva Sutras where it says
``gururupaya''; the guru is the means. Because it is the guru who awakens
your kundalini the guru is given great reverence in this tradition. The
awakening of kundalini that many people struggle, with effort and danger,
to accomplish in a lifetime a true guru can accomplish in a few seconds.
Nevertheless the role of a guru is to awaken the kundalini within you; then
the practice takes place between you and your kundalini. The guru is a
facilitator in the process of awakening kundalini not an ongoing
intermediary between the disciple and kundalini.
<p>
With respect to the guru the classical Shaivist literature takes an especially pragmatic attitude.
Classical literature of Shaivism, such as the Shiva Purana, states that if after one year the
disciple has not arrived at some direct inner experience through the agency of the guru then there
is no fault in seeking another guru. What I read from this is that this path is not one of years of wondering : ``Is something happening?'' but a practical approach in which one should, through the grace of the guru, be brought into direct experience of kundalini.
<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>
<p>

<a name="19"><h2> Is Transcendental Medtiation a kind of Siddha Yoga?</h2></a>

In Transcendental Meditation practice individuals are given a mantra. If one believes that this mantra, through the preliminary puja, is``awakened'' or infused with consciousness then this technique is precisely the same method that is used by some teachers to initiate their studentsinto the practice of kundalini yoga. The idea as exposited by these kundalini yoga teachers is that the consciousness of the mantra resonates with the  the slumbering kundalini and awakens her. This is not the same asthe exposition of the Transcendental Meditation practice nor is it straightforward to resolve these two models of mantra meditation.
<p>
In practice many TM practicioners experience kundalini awakening. Some experience it quite violently. Survey books on kundalini experience, such as Sannella's _The Kundalini Experience_ contain many such case histories although these case histories are not comprehensive enough to indicate whatother factors might have led to the kundalini awakening.  Through checking notes and Teacher Training Courses TM checkers and teachers are minimally prepared for the possibility of kundalini awakening. So while not entirely outside the range of TM practice one would assume that a strong kundaliniawakening is not central to TM practice or a high probablity result.
<p>
In the use of the flying sutra in the TM Sidhis program it is much more the norm to have kundalini related experiences. Many, perhaps most, Sidhas will experience a wide range of activities, technically know as *kriyas*, duringthe practice. (Kriyas will be discussed in the Siddha Mahayoga FAX). The mechanism by which the flying sutra actually awakens the kundalini is unknown to me. I'd be interested to hear any explanations.

<a name="20"><h2>20. Who gives shaktipat initiation?</h2></a>

The shaktipat-centered techniques of siddha mahayoga are taught in a number
of ashrams and centers in India, the US and around the world. 
Any list that I would offer would surely, at this point, be partial, and 
discussing  siddha gurus that I have not met might look like guru rating. 
Thus, in what follows, I simply mentioned siddha gurus that I have personally encountered.

Swami Shivom Tirth is the successor to Swami Vishnu Tirth who wrote the
well known reference  on siddha mahayoga entitled  _Devatma Shakti_. First
brought to the United States by the well known Qi Gong teacher, Bruce Kumar
Frantzis, Swami Shivom Tirth discretely visited the United States for over twenty years. 
Those who met him were introduced to him by other students
or were already his students in India. 
<p>
The majority of  Swami Shivom Tirth's students are Indians, either living
here or in India, but there is a good percentage of westerners as well.
Swami Shivom Tirth is now going into retirement to meditate and write. He
will no longer give initiations. He has left a few ashrams in India and his
 named successor, Swami Shiv Mangal Tirth, runs a small ashram in Sparrow
Bush, NY where he gives shaktipat to qualified students. Both of these
Swamis are now in India and will not return until March 1995. The lineage
of these teachers, extending now into its sixth generation is perhaps the
longest lived of any of the contemporary teachers of siddha mahayoga. I
have had the good fortune to spend a few weeks with these teachers over the
last three years and have been personally impressed by the great spiritual
purity, the high level of integrity and great depth of practical  knowledge
of these teachers. Perhaps because of the relative maturity of their
lineage these teachers seem to have the fullest understanding of the path
of siddha mahayoga among contemporary teachers.

Anandi Ma is the named successor to Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudhanandaji. Shri
Dhyanyogi's precise lineage in unknown to me. He was initiated by a
mysterious yogi in Mt. Abu in Rajasthan state by the name of Shri Yogiraj Parameshwardasji. The predecessors of Parameshwardasji are unknown to me.
 Anandi Ma lives in Antioch, CA with her husband Dileepji who was
also a student of Shri Dhyanyogi. Meeting Shri Dhyanyogi at a very young 
age Anandi Ma passed very quickly into advanced states of samadhi. Shri Dhyanyogi subsequently began to train her to become a teacher in her own right. Anandi
Ma gives shaktipat initation in various locations around the Bay Area and the rest of the country. 
Personally,  I  have only attended one of Anandi Ma's lectures but I have a few
friends who have known her since she was a child and vouch for her genuineness and
integrity. The Dhyanyoga Center's web site gives an excellent overview of their teachers and programs.

Swami Muktananda is the man responsible for the great level of awareness of
siddha mahayoga that there is today. Muktananda tapped into a vast
storehouse of shakti to give shaktipat to dozens of people at a time.  In
1974 I sat crosslegged in a retreat house in Indiananpolis, Indiana with a
few new students and a number of disciples from around the world. As Swami
Muktananda walked by he stroked my forehead a few times. As he did a blue
light streamed down from my forehead and an energy was awakened within me
that immediately set my  body trembling. In this simple but direct way  my
kundalini was unmistakenly and irresistably awakened and I joined the
thousands of people who were thus introduced to siddha mahayoga by Swami Muktananda. Because of
his nearly unrivalled ability to deeply and directly awaken other's
kundalini Swami Muktananda's world movement rapidly grew.  In particular
the Siddha Yoga Dham of America (SYDA) grew quickly around the United States with
major ashrams in South Fallsburg, New York and Oakland, California.
Thousands of people are currently involved in SYDA today and many people from all walks of life are always happy to confirm the value that siddha yoga, as taught within SYDA, has brought to their life. Nevertheless, there is another side to the history of this organization.
<p>
A young woman known as Shri Yogini Malti Devi served as Swami Muktananda's
translator for many years and shortly before his death in October 1982
Swami Muktananda passed on his lineage to Yogini Malti Devi (who became a
renunciant under the name Swami Chidvilasananda) and her brother Swami
Nityananda (see below). 
<p>
 Currently the brother
and sister now run independent groups. Swami Chidvilasananda runs the
Siddha Yoga Dham of America and Swami Nityananda runs a small center in Pine Bush, New
York.

Swami Shanakarananda was one of the sannyasis initiatied by Swami Muktananda before Swami Muktanananda's death and was at one time an influential individual within Swami Muktananda's organization, the Siddha Yoga Dham of America (SYDA).  Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to meet him
but I have enjoyed an electronic correspondance with him.The following is a distillation
of my electronic conversations with Swami Shankarananda and his students.
<p>
Swami Shankarananda left SYDA in 1986 and he subsequently ran the
Shiva Insitute in Santa Monica for four years. The Swami ran the Melbourne ashram for SYDA for three years in the early '80's and in 1990 he was invited by a
group of Australian devotees to do a tour. It was so successful and they
were so happy to see him again that they invited him to return permanently. In 1991
they organised an association called Shiva Meditation Centre and Swamiji was
granted residency. The Shiva Centre is residential, 5 to 7 people at any
given time. Swamiji runs courses and holds satsang on Saturday evenings.
<p>
Swamiji teaches a form of self-inquiry he calls the Shiva Process which is
an assimilation of everything he learned from Baba Muktananda with an emphasis on the
relationship between thought, feeling and the shakti. He does private
meditation sessions and runs Shiva Process groups 3-4 times a week.
The Shiva Process works with the contraction and expansion of energy in
the chakras. Thoughts and feelings which show up in the
chakras are. By
using awareness to investigate which thoughts create an expansion and
which thoughts create contractions insight into the various
unconscious negative tendencies that we carry within us can be gained.
The Shiva Process is powerful and non-dogmatic. It focuses on the
individual's experience of themselves and their relationship to the shakti
within them.
