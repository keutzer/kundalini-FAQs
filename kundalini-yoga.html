<a name="1a"><h2>What is kundalini?</h2></a>


``Kundalini'' literally means coiling, like a snake.
In the classical literature of hatha yoga kundalini is
described as a coiled
serpent at the base of the spine. The image of coiling, like a
spring, conveys the sense of untapped potential energy.
Perhaps more meaningfully kundalini can be described as a
great reservoir of creative energy at the base of the spine.
It's not useful to sit with our consciousness fixed in our
head and think of kundalini as a foreign force running up
and down our spine.  Unfortunately the serpent image may
serve to accentuate this alien nature of the image. It's more
useful to think of kundalini energy as the very foundation
of our consciousness so when kundalini moves through the
sushumna and through our cakras our consciousness
necessarily changes with it.
<p>
The concept of kundalini can also be examined from a strictly
psychological perspective.
From this perspective kundalini can be thought
of as a rich source of psychic or libidinous energy in our
unconscious.
<p>
In the classical literature of Kashmir Shaivism kundalini is described
in  three different manifestions. The first of these is as the
universal energy or <i> para-kundalini</i>.
The second of these is as the energizing function of the body-mind
complex or
<i>prana-kundalini</i>. The third of these is as consciousness or
<i>shakti-kundalini</i> which simultaneously subsumes and intermediates
between these two. Ultimately these three forms are the same but
understanding these three different forms will help to understand the
differerent manifestations of kundalini.

<a name="2"><h2>What does kundalini have to do with spiritual
enlightenment?</h2></a>

<p>
First we need a few concepts:  In yogic anatomy the
sushumna is the central channel and conduit for the
kundalini energy that runs along our spine and up to the
crown of our head. Along this channel are placed additional
channel networks called cakras. These cakras are associated
with major aspects of our anatomy - for example our
throat, heart, solar plexus, and in turn these aspects of our
anatomy are related to aspects of our human nature.
According to the literature of kundalini yoga our experience
of these centers is limited due to knots which restrict the flow
of energy  into these centers. Three knots are particuarly important.
The knot of <i>Brahma</i> which restricts the center at the base of the
spine.
The knot of <i>Vishnu </i> which restricts the heart center and the
knot of
<i>Rudra</i> which
restricts the center between the eyebrows.
These knots form an important framework in yogic thinking and the
stages toward enlightenment are articulated in terms of breaking
through
these knots in the yogic classic the <i>Hatha Yoga Pradipika</i> as
well
as in some of the yoga upanishads.
 Specifically, four stages of progress are described:
<br>
<i>arambha</i>,
<br>
<i>ghata</i>,
<br>
<i>parichaya</i> and
<br>
<i>nishpatti</i>.
<p>
<i>Arambha</i> is associated with breaking the knot of <i>Brahma</i>
and the
awakening of kundalini.
<i>Ghata</i> is associated with breaking the knot of <i>Vishnu</i> and
and
with internal absorption.
<i>Parichaya</i> the absorption deepens and in <i>nishpatti</i> the
knot of
<i>Rudra</i> is pierced and the kundalini may ascend to the center at
the
crown of the head. In this state transcendence is integrated and,
according to
the yogic liteature, the yogi has nothing more to attain.
<p>

<p>
Putting these elaborate physiological decriptions aside, the goal of
kundalini
yoga is the same as the goal of any legimitate spiritual practice: To
be
liberated from the limited bounds of the self-centered and alienated
ego.
In kundalini yoga this is associated with internal manifestations of
the
kundalini but the external manifestations should be similar to any
other
legitiimate spiritual practice.

<a name="4"><h2>So how do I awaken kundalini?</h2></a>
<p>
Indirectly kundalini can be awakened by devotion, by selfless service,
or
by intellectual enquiry.
<p>

Broadly speaking there are two radically different direct approaches to
awakening kundalini. One approach requires initiation by a guru and
relies
upon a technique called
shaktipat, or ``descent of shakti.''  It is variously called:
Siddha Mahayoga, Kundalini Mahayoga or  Sahaja Yoga (Spontaneous
Yoga).
These approaches are treated in the  <a
href="siddha-mahayoga.html">Siddha Mahayoga FAQ</a>.
The other approach uses intentional yogic techniques . The styles
using  intentional techniques include Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Laya
Yoga  or Kriya Yoga.
These approaches are treated in this FAQ.
<p>
Fundamentally the approach of Siddha Mahayoga and the Kundalini Yogas
are different. In Siddha Mahayoga the guru awakens the kundalini and
after that the core of the practice is the inactive and non-willful
surrender to kundalini. In Kundalini Yogas the will is used to awaken
the kundalini and to guide its progress. Clearly these are different
approaches. Nevertheless, elements of the each approach occur in the
practices of the other. Siddha Mahayogins may use asanas, pranayamas
and other hatha yoga practices. On the other hand gurus in Kundalini
Yoga may give infusions of shakti to their students to help them at
particular points in their practice.
<p>

<p><a name="8b"> <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using
effort, in kundalini yogas, as opposed to the grace of the guru,  in
siddha mahayoga, to awaken kundalini?</h2></a>
<p>
Since every practitioner brings his own unique inclinations and
obstacles to the practice of yoga it is very hard to generalize on this
point. In terms of actually awakening kundalini gurus of Siddha
Mahayoga claim that the kundalini is more easily and reliably awakened
by the grace of the guru than by individual effort. In my limited
experience I would agree. with this assertion. While not every
long-term student of either practice necessarily shows signs of
kundalini awakening it is amazing how many people have had instant
awakenings of kundalini through initiation from siddha gurus.
<p>
In terms of encountering difficulties along the path the siddha gurus
would also claim that fewer problems due to kundalini awakening, such
as mental imbalance, are encountered by students of Siddha Mahayoga.
Here I think the results are mixed. It seems to me that the guidance of
the teacher in either Siddha Mahayoga or Kundalini Yoga is more a
determining factor than which style of kundalini practice is employed.
<p>
Generally speaking each style of practice has its strengths and
weakness. The strength of Siddha Mahayoga is the ease with which it
awakens the kundalini. The weakness is that because the kundalini is so
easily awakened by the guru students of Siddha Mahayoga often have
completely undisciplined personal meditation practices. Time is spent
instead to trying to recreate some of their initial experiences by
following the guru around hoping for his or her grace. Some people spend
20 or more years in this manner without ever developing an inner core
of practice or experience.
<p>
The strength of the family of Kundalini Yogas is that the progress is
at least apparently more under the control of the student of the yoga.
These students seem more likely to have disciplined personal practices
and more of an understanding of how the practice relates to their own
experience. Unfortunately for some students this leads to a fairly
egotistical approach to their practice and ultimately the kundalini
energy is used to bolster the ego rather than to merge the ego in
bliss.

<a name="5a"><h2>How is kundalini awakened through mantra
yoga?</h2></a>

In mantra yoga the student is initiated by means of a mantra.
If the kundalini is to be awakened by means of this yoga
then it is essential that the guru gives consciousness or ``chaitanya''
to the mantra.  
This consciousness can be viewed as the 
<i>cit-shakti-kundalini</i>. 
Through repetition of the mantra
the <i> cit-shakti-kundalini</i>  of the
mantra resonates with the <i> cit-shakti-kundalini</i>  of the student
and in this way the student's kundalini is awakened.
<p>
The reader may have noticed that there doesn't seem to be a great deal
of effort applied in this approach. This is true and in many ways this
approach is more akin to Siddha Mahayoga in which the guru can use
sound or ``shabda'' as the instrument of initiation.
<p>

<a name="5b"><h2> How is kundalini awakened through hatha, laya and
kriya yogas?</h2></a>

The practices of hatha, laya and kriya yoga employee literally hundreds
of individual techniques to purify the channels and awaken kundalini.
Despite this tremendous divesity of approaches to the awakening of
kundalini there are only a few underlying models of how kundalini may
be awakened with effort in these practrices.  The following description
draws from the classical texts on kundalini  yoga  the Nath and Tantric
Buddhist lineages as well as on contemporary instruction by American,
Indian and Tibetan masters of kundalini yoga. For each model of the
process of kundalini yoga a little additional yogic terminology will be
required.
<p>
The description of kundalini given earlier suffices for general
purposes; however, if one wishes to  practice the kundalini yogas a
more detailed description is necessary. In fact there are a number of
highly related yogic concepts which must be understood. Kundalini is
often associated with a fierce  hot energy.  In the hatha yogic
terminology of the Nath tradition this energy is known as
<I>rajas</I>
and also as
<I>surya</I>.
In the tantric Buddhist tradition this energy is known as red
<I>bodhicitta</I> and also
as
<I>candali</I> in the Sanskrit language or as
<I>gTummo</I> in Tibetan.
The word <I>gTummo</I> literally means ``the fierce woman.''
The association between kundalini and a fiery energy
runs so deep that this fiery energy is
often considered to be synonymous with kundalini. 
Strictly speaking
these two energies are separate; however, whenever the fiery
<I>surya</I> energy is activated then kundalini stirs and and often when
kundalini stirs the fiery energy is also activated. So while these energies
are not equivalent, from a practical standpoint the activation of one
energy will most often result in the activation of the other.
<p>

The most universal description is that kundalini is awakened
by the uniting of the ``winds''  or ``energies'' 
of
<i>prana</i> and <i>apana</i>.
<i>Prana</i> is the life-giving energy associated with inspiration. It
is associated with feelings of expansion and its center is in the
heart. 
<i>Apana</i> is the downward-voiding energy associated with
defecation. It is associated with feelings of contraction  and its
center is in the anus. The uniting of these two very different forces
creates  a ``spark'' which awakens the kundalini from its slumber.
<p>
Another description is that kundalini is  awakened through the uniting
of the energies of the two channels of <I>ida</I> and <I>pingala</I>.
The <I>ida</I> and <I>pingala</I> are two side
channels which run parallel to central channel,
the <I>sushumna</I>, on its left and right sides respectively.
The <I>ida</I> channel is associated with a cool energy that descends
from the crown
of the head.
The <I>pingala</I> channel is associated with a hot energy that ascends
to the crown.
From the yogic viewpoint ordinary waking consciousness our winds or
energies run in
these two side channels and as a result our minds are unsteady and
prone to anger, greed
and delusion.
The kundalini yogin aims to cause the energies to move out of the
 <I>ida</I> and <I>pingala</I> and into the
<I>sushumna</I>.
When this occurs the knots which hold the kundalini energy in place are
loosened and the kundalini is able to rise.
<p>
A similar description is that kundalini is  awakened through the
uniting of the two bindus  of <i>rajas</i> and <i>retas</i>.
First of all bindu, or literally ``drop'',  means a constituent of the
subtle body.
The bindu <i>rajas</i> is associated with the  egg (or sometimes
menstrual blood) of woman but it more fundamentally refers to a subtle
constituent of both the male and female body. In some texts it says
that this constituent resides at the navel. In other texts it says that
it resides near the perineum.  The Tantric Buddhists call this
constituent ``red bodhicitta'' or literally the ``red
mind-of-enlightenment.''
Whatever it is called, this constituent is associated with a fiery red
energy that rises. It is also associated with the sun. One may also
find other associations such as the ``red lion'' of alchemical
traditions.
<p>
The complement to <i>rajas</i> is <i>retas</i> or shukra.
The bindu <i>retas</i> is associated with the sperm of man but like
<i>rajas</i> it more fundamentally refers to a constituent present in
both men and women. Classical texts are in agreement that this resides
in the subtle body at the crown of the head. The Tantric Buddhists call
this constituent ``white bodhicitta'' or literally the ``white
mind-of-enlightenment.''
Whatever it is called this constituent is associated with a cooling
white energy and is associated with the cooling rays of the moon. One
may also see associations with the ``white eagle'' of alchemical
traditions.
<p>
In summary, the fundamental approaches to awakening kundalini are
through the uniting of the <i>prana</i> and <i>apana</i>, or through
the uniting of the <i>rajas</i> and <i>retas</i>.

<a name="6"><h2>What are the techniques to unite <i>prana</i> and
<i>apana</i>?</h2></a>

In the rich yogic literature extending over at least one thousand years
two techniques for uniting <i>prana</i> and <i>apana</i> stand out.
These are the <I>vase breath</I> and the <I>bandha traya</I> or three
bandhas. These two will be briefly described below.  A few things are
important to note first.  These descriptions are only detailed enough
so that the techniques can be unambiguously identified. They are not
instructions for practice. As will be discussed later there are
inherent dangers in awakening the kundalini and there are also dangers
in mis-practicing techniques which aim at awakening kundalini. Anyone
who wishes to awaken kundalini should find a qualified teacher. The
descriptions below are only to give the seeker a little orientation as
to the nature of the path.
<p>

The vase breath (Sanskrit: <I>kumbhaka</I>, Tibetan: <I>rlung bumpa
can</I>)
 is a technique in which the the <I>apana</I> wind is first drawn up
 from the perineum region to a point about two inches below the navel.
 The <I>apana</I> wind is drawn up using a technique called
 <I>mula-bandha</I> or literally ``root-lock.''  There are a variety of
 descriptions of this technique.
The <I>prana</I> wind is then inspired and drawn down to the the same
area as well. The student then swallows and then slightly tenses the
navel region to create the pot-like posture from which the technique
draws its name. In the yogic literature it is often noted that one
should never use much force in retaining the breath and should only
gradually increase the duration of retention.  To gain success in the
vase breath it is valuable, if not essential, to become very familiar
with the <I>prana</I> and <I>apana</I> winds or energies. If the nature
of these do not become very clear then this technique will only be
another mechanical exercise. If one does gain facility and moving these
energies then without a doubt kundalini can be awakened from her long
slumber.
<p>

Another fundamental technique for uniting <I>prana</I> and <I>apana</I>
is through the application of <I>bandha traya</I> or three <I>
bandhas</I> or locks.  The first lock applied  is the
<I>mula-bandha</I> used to drive upward the <i>apana</i> wind as
described above. The second lock is <I>uddiyana</I>. Some writers give
the etymology of this term as ``flying up.'' It is not fully clear but
the name of this may be derived from the ancient land of Odiyan which
was a haven for Buddhist and Hindu Tantrics. 
In <I>uddiyana bandha</I>
the breath is expelled and the abdomen is brought backward. In this way
the energies in the navel area are drawn in and up. Photographs often
show yogins who appear to have squashed their entire abdominal region.
This is not necessary. The goal is simply to subtly draw the winds
together. The third of lock is <I>Jalandhara bandha</I>. 
The name of this lock may come from
an Indian Mahasiddha who was revered by both Hindu Yogins and Buddhist
Tantrics or alternatively from the city, associated with
kundalini yogic practiced, that is located at the
border of the Punjab.
In Jalandhara bandha the head is brought back a bit and then the chin
is brought down on the chest. This lock keeps the <I>prana</I> locked
below the throat.
<p>
In summary, the goal of the vase breath pranayama and the <I>bandha
traya</I> is the same: the uniting of the <I>prana</I> and
<I>apana</I>. In the vase breath exercise this is done by  using phases
of inspiration and retention and adding muscular control to cup the
winds in a vase or pot below the navel. In <I>bandha traya</I> this is
accomplished by phases of expiration and retention  and adding muscular
control to force the winds together  in the abdominal region.
Intuitively there also seems to be something of a vacuum effect in
<I>bandha traya</I> which is aiming to create a vacuum in which a
suction force will be used to arouse the kundalini.
<p>
Some will be drawn to try to practice these techniques but 
I believe that to do so the guidance of a
teacher is necessary. 
If a teacher is unavailable one might simply try to
become more aware of the <i>prana</i> and <i>apana</i> winds. To become
aware of the <i>prana</i> wind just pay attention to the inspiration
phase of an ordinary breath. The Tibetan word for <i>prana</i>
translates as ``life-holding wind.'' Try to become sensitive to the
life sustaining properties of this wind. Sensitivity to the
<i>apana</i> wind can be developed by paying attention to the muscles
and their sensations during evacuation. 
If you were raised in Western
culture this itself may prove plenty of challenge!

<p>

<a name="7"><h2>What are the techniques for uniting <i>rajas</i> and
<i>retas</i>?</h2></a>

To unite <I>rajas</I> and <I>retas</I> inside the body requires causing
the winds or energies to enter the central channel. Ultimately this
achieves the same end as the process of uniting <I>prana</I> and
<I>apana</I> but the emphasis is a little different. To cause the winds
to enter the central channel there are a continuum of approaches
ranging from very gentle to very forceful.
<p>
In the very gentle approaches one attempts to bring the winds into the
central channel by imagination or concentration alone. One  visualizes
an image, such as a deity or a seed-syllable in the central channel and
lets mind become absorbed in that. It is a common tenet of yogic lore
that where the mind goes the winds will follow. So if the mind can be
kept steadily focussed on inside of the central channel then the winds
will enter there. When the winds enter there the knots holding the
<I>rajas</I> and <I>retas</I> loosen and the two are allowed to flow
together. It is worth noting that it was Gopi Krishna's practice of a
very simliar method that led to his tremendous difficulties with
kundalini. So even very gentle methods can lead to imbalances. In the
more forceful practices the visualizations described above are
complemented by breathing practices such as the vase-breath practice
described earlier.
<p>
If upon reading these descriptions one would like to try to practice
them then a teacher is necessary. If one lacks a teacher but has a
surplus of curiousity one might simply try to become familiar with the
central channel. Take an ordinary breath. How does the spine feel when
inhaling? How does the spine feel upon exhaling? Success in these yogic
practices will require a great sensitivity to the central channel and
much of this sensitivity can be obtained by simply improving one's
awareness of that area.

<a name="8"><h2>Are these really all the techniques for awakening
kundalini by effort?</h2></a>

Of course life couldn't possible be this simple. There are a wide
variety of techniques that serve to awaken kundalini through either
uniting <I>prana</I> and <I>apana</I> or uniting <I>rajas</I> and
<I>retas</I>. Most of these bear some similarity to those described
above.
<p>
 There are a few radically different methods. Some of these are
 extremely forceful. Some yogins, take literally the meaning of
 <I>rajas</I> and <I>retas</I> and seek a literal uniting of these
 constituents. Others take the slumber of the kundalini very literally
 and attempt to very forcefully wake her up by dropping on the floor
 while seated in the  lotus position.
<p>
At the other extreme, in many other approaches no attempt whatsoever is
made to awaken the kundalini directly. In these practices all of the
effort is placed on purifying the nerve channels through physical,
mental and breathing exercises. In the practice of Kriya yoga as taught
by Baba-ji and Lahiri Mahasaya  the kundalini is ``magnetized.''
Apparently in this practice energy is circulated around the central
channel without forcing it into the central channel. In this way it is
expected that the kundalini will be drawn into the central channel.
<p>
<A  HREF = "#top"> Return to table of contents</A>

<p>
<h2><a name="9">Is forcefully awakening kundalini dangerous? </h2></a>
<p>

If we take the psychological perspective and view kundalini
as the power latent in our unconscious then it is easy to
understand that awakening this force is going to bring a
greater amount of unconscious material into our
consciousness.  Even in the best of circumstances this is
likely to be uncomfortable and if an individual is barely
coping with his unconscious even under normal
circumstances then awakening kundalini may push the
individual over into psychosis. This phenomenon has been
documented many times.
<p>

Forceful methods of awakening kundalini pose additional
dangers. As has been mentioned, the breath or <i> prana</i>  is
strongly interdependent on the mind. If one begins to actively control
the breath then the mind will be affected. Many kundalini yogas rely on
this connection. Unfortunately, with incorrect practice rather than
bringing the mind to a greater state of equanimity the breath control
practices can also create even greater imbalances in the mind. Typical
signs of this are extreme agitation and anxiety. In the panorama of
human suffering there is probably no greater suffering than that of a
mentally unbalanced individual and no sadder example of this than
someone who has actually brought a state of mental imbalance onto
himself through improper practice of kundalini yoga.
<p>
As an example an individual named Gopi Krishna awakened his kundalini
by doing unguided meditation on his crown cakra. His life after
awakening was  both blessed by ecstatic bliss and tormented
by  physical and mental discomfort. Eventually his
experience stabilized. He wrote down his experiences in a
recently re-released autbiography entitled ``Living with
Kundalini.''  Gopi Krishna's autobiography appears to be an
honest representation of his experiences but it is only one
extreme datapoint in the panorama of experience on
kundalini yoga. It represents dangers in forceful unguided
practice but it is not representative of a typical
practicioner's experience.

Some gurus and students of kundalini yoga seem to feel that such
warnings regarding kundalini practice are overblown, but there is
simply no doubt that improper application of breath control practices
can lead to mental imbalance. Breath control practices which typically
do not use breath retention are much safer. Kriya yoga practices which
do not focus on purifying or ``magnetizing'' the  central channel
without directly attempting to awaken the kundalini are also much
safer. Finally, the role of a fully qualified guru cannot be estimated
here. It is not just that the guru has traversed the path but a fully
qualified guru of kundalini yoga has the ability to intervene in the
mind and body of the student to correct imbalances.

<p><a name="10a"><h2>But even if kundalini is dangerous,  isn't it a
faster way to enlighenment?</h2></a>
<p>

First of all it may be useful to observe that there is no
technique  currently known on earth that appears to be
rapidly catapulting large number of individuals toward
enlightenment.  Because kundalini yogas deal so directly
with a powerful enlightening force it seems natural that
they would be ``faster'', but there appears to be alot of
tortoise and hare phenomena at work with newbie
kundalini yogins. Many people begin kundalini yogas, have
strong initial experiences and then become frightened.
Many who perservere through this initial phase become
distracted by the energy and focus on temporal and
phenomenal applications of the energy.

<a name="15"><h2>What are the origins of the kundalini yogas?</h2></a>

Hatha, laya and kriya yoga all trace their origins back to the era of
the Indian Mahasiddhas.  This era spanned the 8th and 12th centuries in
Northern India, Nepal and Tibet. The key figures in this era included
the Mahasiddhas Matsyenranath and his student Gorakshanath as well as
Jalandhara and Jalandhara's student Krishnacarya. Gorakshanath and
Matsyendranath are venerated as the originators of the Natha lineage.
Jalandhara is commemorated in the  practice of the Jalandhara mudra but
he and his student Krishnacarya are also deeply venerated for their
roles in the early years of Tantric Buddhism. In fact each of these
great yogins is venerated both in Hindu Tantric and in Buddhist Tantric
schools.  Of these individuals there are several works attributed to
Jalandhara and Krishanacarya in the canon of Indian Buddhist Tantric
literature which has survived in Tibetan translation.

<a name="16"><h2>What is the classical literature of kundalini
yoga?</h2></a>

The classical works of hatha, kriya and laya yoga include:
Gorakshashatakam,
Hatha Yoga Pradipika,
Gherandha Samhita,
Shiva Samhita,
and a group of about twenty works known as the Yoga Upanishads.
References to translations of these works  will be given  in the answer
to the question <a HREF="#20">Where can I learn more?></a>
<p>
Each of these works is very brief, typically less than 500 verses and
yet the entire literature of hatha, kriya and laya yoga is drawn from
these works.  Anyone interested in kundalini yoga can benefit from
taking the time to read these classical works but to actually practice
the techniques described in these works a teacher is required. This is
reiterated within the text of these works themselves.

<a name="17"><h2>What is the precise role of the teacher in kundalini
yoga? Can I learn kundalini yoga through books?</h2></a>

The teacher is highly revered in kundalini yoga, just as in other
schools of yoga. A recurrent theme in the texts of kundalini yoga is
that if one needs a teacher to learn everyday skills such as reading
and writing how much more one needs a teacher to master the practice of
kundalini yoga.
<p>
The first role of the teacher in kundalini yoga is as an instructor in
the practices of kundalini yoga. The classical works of kundalini yoga
repeat again and again that only those practices learnt from the guru
will bear fruit and all other attempts to practice will only bring
misery. This may seem a bit melodramatic but the point is that these
practices are sufficiently subtle that they can only be properly
conveyed through personal instruction by an individual who has himself
been properly instructed.
<p>
The second role of a teacher in kundalini yoga is in monitoring the
progress of the student. A tremendous variety of positive and negative
experiences can manifest on the path of kundalini yoga. A true
kundalini teacher will not only have encountered a wide range of these
experiences but will have a subtle sensitivity to the students nervous
system and will be able to intuit when practice is leading to
imbalance.
<p>
Ultimately, whether following the path of effort or the path of grace,
the true guru is the <i>guru-tattva</i> or guru-principle - this is the
kundalini-shakti herself.
<p>
For those individuals that have not been able to find a teacher there
are a few published materials that are apparently intended for beginning
self study.
There are a number of manuals available from Yogi Bhajan and his students.
These are referred to in the section immediately below.
Swami Chetanananda has a guided meditation that serves as an introduction
to the practice of kundalini yoga. It is available from Rudra Press.

<a name="19"><h2>Who teaches kundalini yoga?</h2></a>

Yogic practices aimed at raising the kundalini through effort are
taught in a number of ashrams and centers in India, the US and around
the world. The following is a list of known centers in the United
States and each of these serves as one of the principal seats of the
teacher .  Although I am no expert or
authority on any of these teachers, where I have some first-hand
information I thought it would be useful to add it - it may be a bit
anecdotal for some tastes. If anyone finds any of the information below
is
inacurrate please inform me and I will update it. Good luck!

Yogi Bhajan brought kundalini yoga to the West in 1969, at the age of
39, and founded the Happy, Healthy Holy Organization (3HO).  Yogi
Bhajan is a Sikh and his writings indicate that he is ``the Chief
Religious  and Administrative Authority for the Sikh Dharma in the
Western Hemisphere.''  Yogi Bhajan has taught an organized regimen of
yogic practices aimed at clearing the subtle nerve channels and
ultimately awakening the kundalini.
<p>
The precise lineage of Yogi Bhajan has been impossible for me to
determine. Equally difficult has been to understand at what point in
time the hatha yoga teachings taught by the founder of the Naths,
Gorakshanath, became intertwined with the Sikh teachings tracing from
Guru Nanak.  Over the hundreds of years in India these two groups must
have often come in contact but the precise time at which the yogic
teaching passed into the Sikh lineage is unclear.  A  number of
introductory yoga manuals and videotapes have been published by 3HO and
should be available via the number above. In addiition, Yogi Bhajan has
been liberal in his training of teachers to pass on his lineage and a
few are quite active. We will mention only one, Ravi Singh.

Among Yogi Bhajan's students Ravi Singh has been especially active in
establishing his center and in publishing books and videotapes. I found
his book <i>Kundalini  Yoga for Strength, Success and Spirit</i> among
the best of  those published by Yogi Bhajan's students.

B. K. S. Iyengar is a teacher in the hatha yoga tradition that passed
from Shri Ramamohan Brahmacarya, to Tirumalai Krishnamacharya and then
onto B. K. S. Iyengar. For quite some time I was under the impression
that B. K. S. Iyengar's exposition of hatha yoga  did not extend to
encompass hatha yoga practices aimed at awakening the kundalini and I
once made this assertion in response to a question on the net.  A
series of email exchanges with a student  in Krishnamacharya's lineage
straightened me out on this score although such advanced teachings are
not a part of the normal regimen.

<b>Kundalini Yoga in the Tibetan Tradition</b>

<p>
Kundalini yoga is taught in all four (Nyingma, Kargyudpa, Sakya and
Gelugpa) of the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. For this reason this
FAQ would be very incomplete if it failed to mention something
about Tibetan schools of
kundalini yoga. On the other hand it would be extremely mis-leading to
simply give a list of Tibetan Buddhist centers in America as though one
could walk right in and sign up for a course on kundalini yoga. Some
history may help here.
<p>
The tradition  of the Indian Mahasiddhas who founded  Hatha yoga and
the Indian Mahasiddhas who founded many of the important lineages  of
Tibetan Buddhism are intertwined. As a result it is no surprise that
these two traditions share many practices in common. In particular
kundalini yoga, known as candali yoga (Tibetan: gTummo rnal 'byor)  in
Tantric Buddhism, is taught in the Completion Stages of a number of
Tibetan Buddhist practices.
To better understand this it will be necessary to put the gTummo
yoga practice in the broader
context of Tibetan Buddhist practice.
Unfortunately, there is only  sufficient space here to barely
overview the stages of Tibetan Buddhist Tantric practice. Briefly they
can be organized as follows:  First come preliminaries such as taking
refuge in the Buddha and  making prostrations and offerings to the
Buddha,  the teachings and the assembly. Some teachers will require
that preliminary practices, such as taking refuge, be performed 100,000
times. When a teacher is satisfied with the students performance of the
preliminaries then an initiation into a deity practice may be
conveyed.  This entails meditating on a deity and its
mandala, repeating its mantra and performing service to the deity. In
Tantric Buddhism a deity is not viewed as an external god but rather a
state of one's own transformed mind. Deity practice eliminates one's
clinging to one's ordinary appearance. With these practices a student
begins the Generation (or Cultivation) stage of practice.
<p>
With the Completion stage come a variety of yogic practices. Of these
candali (or kundalini) yoga forms the core of Completion stage practice
in the Six Yogas of Naropa as well as the Cakrasamvara, Hevajra and
Yamantaka tantras. The actual practice of  candali yoga has its own
preliminaries. These include physical yogic practices similar to
asanas. Next come a series of imaginations (or visualizations) and
finally breath control practices aimed at awakening the kundalini. The
encouraging news here is that the hatha yoga lineages have been
successfully maintained for over a thousand years within Tibetan
Buddhism. The challenge for the student of kundalini yoga is to find
access to them.  Following the path from preliminaries, through
Generation Stage practices to Completion Stage practices requires a
great  sincerity and commitment to Buddhist practice and many years of
concentrated effort but there are great extremes in the presentation of
these teachings.  
<p>
For some teachers of Tibetan Buddhism gTummo is only taught within
the context of a three year retreat.
At the other extreme there are some teachers of Tibetan Buddhism who
have openly offered detailed instruction in gTummo yoga to anyone who cared
to attend a seminar. In one particular seminar everything from refuge,
to initiation to gTummo instruction was offered within  a single weekend.
In summary, kundalini yoga has a pivotal role within the practice of Tibetan
Buddhism but it is deeply embedded within this comprehensive path to
spiritual development. As a result the devoted practitioner of Tibetan
Buddhism will almost certainly be exposed to kundalini yoga at some point
in his practice. On the other hand an individual looking to a Tibetan
Buddhist teacher for immediate instruction in kundalini yoga is almost certain
to become frustrated and disappointed.

The Babylon of books on hath, laya and other kundalini yogas is built
upon a relatively small foundation of a few classical works on these
yogas. Anyone wishing to truly understand these yogas would do well to
start with these short and pithy classical works and then evaluate the
later works from this foundation.
