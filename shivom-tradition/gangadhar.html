The Shaktipat system of Yoga begins with Swami Gangadhar Tirth Maharaj.
Although this system is quite old, it has existed secretly like an
undercurrent in Hindu society and has been known to a few spiritual
aspirants in different places from time immemorial. The end of the
nineteenth century witnessed the revival of this tradition with Swami
Gangadhar Tirth Maharaj.  Swami Gangadhar Tirth was born into a Brahmin
family in District Mathura in the northern part of India. Who initiated him
into the Shaktipat system, what was the extent of his realizations, and
where he stayed during his formative years is not known  What information
has been gained about him is only this: He had a small cottage near a pond
named Chandan Talab in Jagannathpuri in the eastern part of India. This
swami was so full of renunciation, fond of solitude and engrossed in his
spiritual practices that he neither left his cottage nor invited people to
come to his place. Even people living nearby did not know that a realized
soul was living near them. During this time, the revered Swamiji was only
attended by a single devotee named Karali who used to arrange for food by
begging in the nearby village.

Swamiji was so indifferent toward the world that he initiated only one
disciple into the system of Shaktipat.  This one disciple, named Kali
Kishore, came to be known as Shri Swami Narayan Tirth Dev Maharaj. It is
also a mystery as to when Swami Gangadhar Tirth Maharaj left his mortal
body because his only disciple, Swami Narayan Tirth Dev Maharaj, had gone
back to his home state of East Bengal after having been initiated into the
system of Shaktipat.
