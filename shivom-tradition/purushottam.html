Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirth Maharaj was the Sanyas Guru of Swami Vishnu
Tirth Maharaj. A Sanyas Guru is a spiritual teacher who initiates one
into the system of, sanyas, or renunciation. He lived in the Siddhayoga
Center of Benaras after his own initiation into Sanyas by Swami Bharati
Krishna Tirth Maharaj, who was the Shankaracharya of Jagannathpuri at that
time. The following is a brief account of his career.
<p>
Swami Shakar Purushottam Tirth Maharaj, originally known as Shri Venukumar
Chattopadhyaya, was born in Lakshmipur in the District of Tripura in East
Bengal in the year 1890. His parents were religious people and this had a
definite bearing on the inclinations of his mind from the beginning of his
life. He also carried strong spiritual seeds accumulated by virtuous deeds
in his past life. He had a natural tendency to live in the company of holy
men and to be absorbed in spiritual pursuits. His mother died when he was
only five years old, but he consoled his other three brothers by telling
them this: ''It is true that human beings have their individual mothers but
there is a Divine Mother who is the mother of all. She in fact is the
mistress of this world and is the beginning and end of all. Our mother has
merged into Her. She will certainly give us the best care and remove our
sufferings.''
<p>
Shri Venukumar, in fact, thus forgot his worldly mother and became a
lifelong worshiper of Divine Mother Kali, whose blessings he sought
throughout his life. After dedicating himself completely to her, he visited
many holy places and stayed in a number of spiritual centers. In spite of
these efforts, his desire to have a direct experience of the Divine Mother
remained unfulfilled. Ultimately he received the blessings of Swami Narayan
Tirth Maharaj at Madaripur who captivated him for the remainder of his
life.

initiated him into the Shaktipat system and
he enrolled as a Brahmachari there. For  eight years he served his Guru
continuously with untiring labor.  East Bengal is a unique country because
nearly the entire area  is covered by water for about eight months out of
the year. To  collect dry firewood, beg for food from nearby areas and
provide  meals for a number of guests visiting the Ashram at such a time
was never an easy job. Furthermore, since his teacher was a great
disciplinarian, the disciples were punished for even their smallest faults.
Shri Venukumar was, however, very open minded and patient. Ultimately,
Swamiji declared Venukumar to have stood successful to the test and blessed
him to go out and propagate the Shaktipat system in the world.
<p>
Shri Venukumar, who had come to be known as Brahmachari Atmananda Prakash,
traveled far and wide and met a number of holy persons. He continued to do
his spiritual practices and finally requested Sanyas initiation from Swami
Narayan Tirth. Swamiji directed him to Swami Bharati Krishna Tirth of
Jagannathpuri, the Shankaracharya of Govardhan Math.  Swami Bharati Krishna
Tirth kindly accepted Brahmachariji and named him Swami Shankar Purushottam
Tirth Maharaj after initiating him into Sanyas.
<p>
Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirth Maharaj laid the foundation of a center in
Uttar Kashi near the bank of the Bhagirathi River. He called this center
the Shankar Math. Since his following consisted mostly of people from West
Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the disciples were worried that Swamiji
would not be able to spend much time with them. Therefore, another center
named Siddhiyog Ashram at Varanashi was built for him shortly after this.
<p>
Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirth Maharaj initiated a number of disciples
into the Shaktipat system and wrote several books in Bengali such as 
<i>Yoga Wani</i>, <i>Japa Sadhana</i>, and <i>Guruvani</i> 
which were later translated into Hindi.
He also wrote a short treatise in English entitled <i>Who Am I?</i>   Swamiji
gave up his mortal body in 1958 in Calcutta and merged with Divine Mother
Kali. 
The books <i>Guru Vani</i>
and
<i>Yoga Vani</i>
have also been translated into English and are available from:
