Swami Shivmangal Tirth  was born in the State of Gujarat in India
in 1945.  He came into contact with 
<a href="vishnutirth.html">Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj</a>
and 
<a href="shivomtirth.html">Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj</a>
in 1966, and being deeply impressed with the spiritual powers of these
two great men, he took Shaktipat Initiation.  
He  renounced the world and
became a permanent member of the Ashram in 1972 and he was initiated as a
Brahmachari in 1974.   
Swamiji received initiation into the order of
renunciation (Sanyas), which he took in 1984 from Shri Swami Shivom Tirth
Maharaj.  
Swamiji first came to the USA in March of 1985.  He initially
resided at the Ashram near Bastrop, Texas for a few years, then he became
President of the Swami Shivom Tirth Ashram in Sparrow Bush, New York after the
Ashram was opened in 1991.  Since then he has initiated many disciples into
Shaktipat and has been spreading this method of meditation both in the
Western Hemisphere and in India.

Swamiji uniquely combines gentleness and humility with  spiritual power.
Upon first meeting Swamiji one person said:
''If this is the fruit, then I must meet the tree (Swami Shivom Tirth).''
<p>
He is author of the book <i>Guidelines to Shaktipat Initiation</i>.
